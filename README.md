# Simple form validation

This project contains a simple form validation implementation.

# Objectives

The objective of this project is to use custom hooks in order to
validate a form containing inputs with the same logic.
For instance here: Name and FirstName.

# Implementation

In order to keep it simple, we only check the length of the inputs.

# Bonus

We added a custom wrapper in order to be reusable first
